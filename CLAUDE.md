# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Multi-person calorie tracking app. Users log meals, manage people with daily calorie goals, and maintain a catalog of recipes/ingredients/cooked foods. Built with TanStack Start (React 19 + file-based routing) on the frontend and Convex as the serverless backend, with optional Clerk authentication.

## Commands

- **Install**: `bun install`
- **Dev server**: `bun run dev` (port 3000) — also run `bunx convex dev` in a separate terminal
- **Build**: `bun run build`
- **Lint**: `bun run lint` / `bun run lint:fix`
- **Type check**: `bun run typecheck` (checks both app and convex)
- **Test**: `bun run test` (Vitest, jsdom env, files matching `src/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}`)
- **Format**: `bun run format` (Prettier: no semicolons, single quotes, trailing commas)
- **Add shadcn component**: `bunx --bun shadcn@latest add <component>`

Before submitting changes, run: `bun run lint && bun run typecheck && bun run build`

## Architecture

**Frontend** (`src/`):
- `routes/` — File-based TanStack Router pages. Route tree is auto-generated in `routeTree.gen.ts` (do not edit).
- `features/` — Feature modules organized by domain (cooking, manage, meals, people).
- `components/ui/` — Shared shadcn/ui primitives (style: `base-mira`, icons: `lucide-react`).
- `integrations/` — Provider config for Clerk (`clerk/`) and Convex (`convex/`).
- `lib/` — Shared utilities. Path alias: `@/*` maps to `./src/*`.

**Backend** (`convex/`):
- `schema.ts` — Database schema (tables: people, personGoalHistory, foodGroups, ingredients, recipes, recipeVersions, recipeVersionIngredients, cookSessions, cookedFoods, cookedFoodIngredients, meals, mealItems).
- `nutrition.ts` — Main query/mutation logic for the domain.
- `auth.config.ts` — Clerk JWT auth config for Convex.
- `_generated/` — Auto-generated Convex code (do not edit).

**Key patterns**:
- React Compiler is enabled via `@rolldown/plugin-babel` with `reactCompilerPreset`.
- `@convex-dev/react-query` bridges Convex with TanStack Query.
- TypeScript strict mode with `noUnusedLocals` and `noUnusedParameters`.

## Convex Conventions

- System fields `_id` and `_creationTime` are automatic — don't add them to schemas.
- Use `v.id("tableName")` for foreign keys, not raw strings.
- Use indexed queries where indices exist; add new indices in `schema.ts` for new access patterns.
- Auth-protected paths must call `requireAuthenticatedUser`.
- Preserve historical data: archive referenced records rather than hard-deleting.

### Schema Migrations (expand-migrate-contract)

1. **Expand**: Deploy compatibility code (`bunx convex deploy`)
2. **Migrate**: Run one-off `internalMutation`/`internalAction` on prod (`bunx convex run --prod <module:function> '{}'`)
3. **Contract**: Remove migration code and redeploy

## Environment Variables

Required in `.env.local`:
- `VITE_CONVEX_URL` — Convex deployment URL
- `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` — Convex deployment name
- `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` — Clerk publishable key (for auth UI)

<!-- convex-ai-start -->
This project uses [Convex](https://convex.dev) as its backend.

When working on Convex code, **always read `convex/_generated/ai/guidelines.md` first** for important guidelines on how to correctly use Convex APIs and patterns. The file contains rules that override what you may have learned about Convex from training data.

Convex agent skills for common tasks can be installed by running `npx convex ai-files install`.
